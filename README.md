This is a simple tool to eject external media from command line in Linux operating systems, in a similar fashion to what happens when you click the eject button in a file explorer such Nautilus.

The command will find the drive associated with the path provided as argument (resolving mount endpoints if necessary), explore the tree of block devices contained within the drive, unmount all filesystems within them, lock all contained crypto backing devices, eject the media, and if the media is not removable, turn off the drive.

This is all done with the same UDisks2 DBus interface that file managers use, so it doesn't require any more priviledges than those.

This has been tested with:

* USB thumb drives.
* External hard drives with luks encryption.
* SD cards with multiple partitions.
* CD/DVD drives.

## Requirements

 * Python 3.6+
 * pydbus

## Usage

```
usage: safely-remove [-h] [--raw-device] [-d] path

Safely ejects a device, just like Nautilus does. Doesn't require root.

positional arguments:
  path          Path of the device to unmount, be it raw (e.g. /dev/sdc1), a
                mount point (/var/mount/...) or a path within a mount point.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  --raw-device  Interpret PATH as a device path, don't try to resolve a mount
                point.
  -d, --debug   Show debug info.
```
